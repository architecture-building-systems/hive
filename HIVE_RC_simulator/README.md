# **HIVE RC_simulator** 

Still under development, but testers are welcome! Installation instructions:

 1. Copy all the files in the userObjects folder into your local userObjects folder (see Grasshopper's <special folders>).

 2. Copy clipper.dll (from the clipper folder) to C:\Program Files\Rhinoceros 5.0 (64-bit)\System\clipper_library.dll

 3. Open hive_main_development.gh (working file and currently a mess) or hive_basic_setup.gh (a cleaner version showing the workflow)
