CORE is the folder containing all simulation engines and databases HIVE uses:

- solar simulation
- SIA380.1
- SIA 2024
- etc...


These components are in principle stand-alone. They can be build either traditionally in Visual Studio, or with [Honey-badger](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/honey-badger).

They are all packaged together in the `Hive/Mothercell`.
