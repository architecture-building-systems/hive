# **HIVE RC_simulator** 

## Installation

Hive is still under development, but early testers are welcome! Installation instructions:

 1. Copy the contents of the userObjects folder into your local userObjects folder (see Grasshopper's <special folders>).

 2. Copy clipper.dll (from the Libraries folder) to the Grasshopper 'Components' special folder ('%AppData%\Grasshopper\Libraries\').


## Folder Description
* **auxiliary**: weather files and occupancy schedules
* **libraries**: Find here the clipper.dll file necessary for shading calculations
* **examples**: All the grasshopper files being used for development. These will be streamlined into simple examples.
* **src**: python source code for all the HIVE user objects
* **userObjects**: Hive user objects which need to be copied in the grasshopper userObjects folder
