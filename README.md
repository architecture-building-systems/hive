# HIVE

HIVE is a collection of Grasshopper components and workflow templates designed to facilitate flexibility in informed decision making during the early stages of building design.

The aim of HIVE is to increase the availability of tools developed during research projects at the Chair of Architecture and Building Systems, ETH Zurich.

## Projects currently in this repository:

### **RC_simulator** 

A native energy simulation toolset for Grasshopper! A series of user objects based on resistor-capacitor model in the [RC_BuildingSimulator](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/RC_BuildingSimulator) repository. For tool documentation and developer's notes check the [project wiki](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/hive/wiki/Hive_RC_simulator). Currently still under development.

**Demo** As a proof of concept of the tool, a parametric shading surface is applied to a window. The energy impact of the different shading length can be viewed in real time in Grasshopper. This can be used to optimize or compare geometries.

## Other projects in the pipeline:

* **Net-zero energy building assesment** (Laura Cowie): Workflow sets in Ladybug and Honeybee for assessing design options for a net-zero building refurbishment.

* **Panelling tool** (Stefan Caranovic): A panelling tool recently circulated within the chair. A possible enhancement of this tool would be to include PV panel visualisation (Linus Walker).
