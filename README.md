# HIVE

HIVE (working name) is a collection of Grasshopper components and workflow templates designed to facilitate flexibility in informed decision making during the early stages of building design.

The tools are based on research conducted by the Chair of Architecture and Building Systems, ETH Zurich.  

## Projects currently in this repository:

### **HIVE grasshopper library** 

A series of user objects based on resistor-capacitor model in the [RC_BuildingSimulator](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/RC_BuildingSimulator) repository. Documentation and developer's notes can be found in the [project wiki](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/hive/wiki).

**Use Case:** The first use case is based on an exercise in the course Energy and Climate Systems III, where the energy impact of the length of an overhang is assessed.

## Projects to be included:

* **Net-zero energy building assesment**: Workflows in Ladybug and Honeybee developed by Laura Cowie to assess design options for a net-zero building refurbishment.
