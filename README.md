# HIVE

HIVE is a collection of Grasshopper components and workflow templates designed to facilitate flexibility in informed decision making during the early stages of building design.

The aim of HIVE is to increase the availability of tools developed during research projects at the Chair of Architecture and Building Systems, ETH Zurich.  

## Overview

Hive consists of (A) Grasshopper components to simulate stuff and (B) Grasshopper components to handle data flow and input-output stuff. See Figure below. 

Furthermore, (C) example Grasshopper files (.gh) can be found in the [Exercises folder](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/hive/tree/master/GrasshopperExamples)
